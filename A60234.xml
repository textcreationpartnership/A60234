            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Excellency and great Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> hath been well judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been the cauſe of the main Attempts that have been made to deprive us of its Divine Authority; the conſideration of which ſhould move us to attend more earneſtly to it. For whatever other Difficulties may for ſome time have been ſtarted by ſuch wary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50877:4"/>as meant no harm to Religion, to hinder the Reception of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> with the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs that other parts of the holy Scriptures were admitted; yet he that well weighs the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have from it, of taking a more full and clear account of the Uſe and Abrogation of the Jewiſh Ceremonies, and of Chriſts being the End of the Law, and of the Nature and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Office, as Mediator between God and Men, will conclude That he that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hath ever envyed Man-kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might promote their happineſs, hath been active in giving weight to thoſe Scruples which if they had been pertinaciouſly adhered to, would ſo far have brought upon the Church an irreparable Loſs.</p>
            <p>But the peculiar Meditations which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of this Day doth call us to, may yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offer ſomething to us of more immediate concern; in that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> doth fully ſet forth and magnifie the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and the Vertue, Benefits, and Dignity of the one <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of his <hi>Death.</hi> Through which, ſeeing that we have the greateſt Advantages that our faln and miſerable condition did ſtand in need of, and ſuch as the Great God could not beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us any more agreeable, This may more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be preſumed to have an Aſcendant upon our minds, which nothing but a ſottiſh Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50877:4"/>or baſe Ingratitude can defeat, to make us acknowledge and admire the watchful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for our good, in that this Sacred <hi>Book</hi> hath now for many Ages, without the leaſt heſitancy been received, as inſpired from Gods Holy Spirit, by the Univerſal Church of God, and conſequently to ſecure our heedful regard to the main Scope of it.</p>
            <p>Which (more eſpecially as to the former Chapters of this Epiſtle,) is to recommend to us the Doctrine of Chriſt, and to require our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Reception of it, and Submiſſion of our ſelves to the power and efficacy of it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.</note> That <hi>we give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip;</hi> conſidering with our ſelves what poſſibility there can be for us to <hi>eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 3, &amp; 4</note> 
               <hi>and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own Will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of all this is farther laid before us by the holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> from the Dignity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of the Perſon of Chriſt, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Moſes,</hi> but far above all the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels of God.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50877:5"/>
            <p>And this partly from the Eternity of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; this Eternal Son of God being <hi>the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, by whom he made the Worlds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And partly, from what this Eternal Son, after he was Incarnate, and had aſſumed our nature did acquire, or was conferr'd upon him; God having <hi>appointed him Heir of all things,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directing us to expect all that Good which by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> from that Right and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he was created to, we had loſt, only in and through Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.</note> who <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> and was, <hi>for the ſuffering of Death, Crowned with Glory and Honour, having all things put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8, 9.</note> God thereby ſignifying, That that ſtate of Humiliation, to which the Son of God was pleaſed to ſubmit himſelf, whatever mean thoughts vain and proud men might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of it, was a thing highly pleaſing to him, and in his infinite Wiſdom directed to excellent Ends; in which his Goodneſs and Propenſity to favour Man kind, ſhould be moſt eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the aſtoniſhment indeed both of Men and Angels, but to the peculiar benefit of the firſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.</note> For <hi>he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but he took on him the Seed of</hi> Abraham; and that in order to this infinitely good and wiſe End,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50877:5"/>advantageous to miſerable and loſt Man, even to a miracle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</note> That <hi>he by the grace of God ſhould taſt Death for every Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall this which was ſo highly pleaſing to God on the behalf of Man, not be ſufficiently eſteemed and valued by Man, who hath the ſole benefit of it? Should not this unexpreſſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of the Eternal Son of God be a powerful Motive to us, to make us moſt freely exert the utmoſt Powers we have in giving a ready and affectionate entertainment to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, and in yielding a moſt cordial and ſincere ſubmiſſion to it; even ſuch as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a true love of him, may expreſs the great ſenſe we have of his love to us?</p>
            <p>To this very end doth the Author of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> add this conſideration to others that he had laid down, taken from the admirable Love and Condeſcenſion of the Son of God, that we ſhould be moſt ſolicitouſly careful, even with warmth and all earneſtneſs, to <hi>hear his Voite To day,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In my diſcourſing of which words, I will do theſe two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. I will Explain the moſt material words and expreſſions in the Text, that we may fix upon the proper Notion of the nature of this our Bondage, and our Deliverance from it.</item>
                  <item>2. I will offer ſome of the moſt pertinent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations I can, to quicken our thoughts and Apprehenſions of the whole matter, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us for receiving the kindly Influences of all, in ſuch a way as may be moſt agreeable to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50877:6"/>Solemn occaſion of our meeting together this Day.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For Explication of the words, and the true Notion of the thing. The Innocency and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of our bleſſed Saviours Life is judged to be one reaſon among others of what St. <hi>Peter</hi> told the <hi>Jews,</hi> Act. 2.24. That <hi>it was not poſſble that he ſhould be holden of death:</hi> But this is of it ſelf a Sufficient reaſon that none ſhould be ſo vain as to think that when we ſpeak of the Death of Chriſt, we can be ſuppoſed to underſtand any thing elſe by it, but only that Temporal Death which he ſuffered upon the Croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our own caſe is ſo wholly different, that though we have the Honour to be of that Nature of which Chriſt did partake, yet all we being polluted and <hi>guilty before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.</note> we ſhall not come up to the full ſenſe of the Scripture, when we are told that <hi>Death</hi> is the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56.</note> and that the <hi>Sting</hi> of it is <hi>ſin;</hi> nor ſhall we be ſufficiently ſenſible of death, as proceeding from, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of, and always accompanied with the dreadful Wrath of God, unleſs when we ſpeak of that <hi>Death</hi> of which <hi>the Devil had the power;</hi> and the <hi>fear</hi> of which made men <hi>ſubject to Bondage all their life-time;</hi> we do, as in reaſon we ought, under ſtand by it, not only the ſeparation of the Soul and the Body, but more eſpecially Eternal Death, and in the general the dreadful Curſe in its full
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50877:7"/>latitude, to which Man was obnoxious by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sin; ſo that the meaſure of the hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Death we ſpeak of, is to be taken from hence, becauſe it is the effect of Gods Wrath, and that becauſe of Sin.</p>
            <p>Now conſequently hereupon, if we would judge a right of that <hi>Bondage</hi> to which men are <hi>ſubject</hi> through the <hi>fear</hi> of this, we muſt ſeriouſly think with our ſelves how it could be otherwiſe to them that are ſuppoſed to lie under the Guilt of ſin, and under the Senſe of the Puniſhment that belongs to it, but that the Malediction of God, and the approaching of a certain Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Hell it ſelf, and everlaſting burnings, and all that can ſtrike horror into the minds of men, ſhould ever be ready to offer themſelves to their thoughts; and This ſo unavoidably <hi>all their life-time,</hi> that nothing can ſhew them any rational ſufficient Ground to eſcape what they are afraid of, when they ſeriouſly think of all this without reſpect to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And can it be otherwiſe conceived, but that this muſt be a moſt wretched condition, fitly called a <hi>Bondage,</hi> not permitting men to do any thing with Freedom, who cannot be otherwiſe, but <hi>all their life time ſubject</hi> to this ſlavery of <hi>Sin,</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and of <hi>Death?</hi> For all theſe in the iſſue do come to the ſame; and therefore the fear of Temporal death as that leads to Eternal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50877:7"/>death, but eſpecially the fear of the laſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.10.</note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Inheritance</hi> of Mans <hi>Folly,</hi> which as to a <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Wrath, Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> a <hi>deſpiſed</hi> and <hi>forſaken Father,</hi> and therefore now a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge,</hi> will <hi>appoint</hi> him as his everlaſting <hi>Portion,</hi> in a place where there ſhall be nothing but <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> cannot but ſeiſe men, who being out of Chriſt, are obnoxious to it, with all anxiety, horror, and anguiſh of mind.</p>
            <p>Thus poor miſerable Man finds an endleſs torture in himſelf, which ſo wholly poſſeſſeth him, as to ſeem not to admit of any further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, if my Text did not mind us that the great Enemy of Man-kind, the Devil, is ever active and reſtleſs in adding all the weight and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he can to this Bondage; who beſides his Tyranny and Uſurpation upon men, which could not exceed the extent that Gods Permiſſion had given it for the Puniſhment of former ſins; and beſides whatever claim he might make to men upon their Voluntary ſubmiſſion to him, as conſequent upon his having ſeduced them from their obedience to their Creator; which yet, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had no right to diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that their continued ſlavery was an addition to their Crime, as well as to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, could not give him any juſt right or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them: I ſay beſides all this, the Devil
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50877:8"/>doth come upon Man with a more dreadful aſſault, as having his fury armed with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, as the Executioner of his Wrath upon Malefactors already adjudged to death, and conſequently is ſaid, as to the never-failing ſucceſs of what his malice could prompt him to, to have <hi>had the power of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that Man, as conſidered without an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in what Chriſt hath done for him, was in a double Bondage of Sin and of Puniſhment. The Devil was the Author of, and the Solicitor to Sin, by the entrance of which <hi>into the World Death</hi> alſo <hi>entred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>and paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned;</hi> And through Sin it was that he had <hi>the power of death,</hi> that is, of inflicting death both of body and ſoul. By this it was that the Devil reigned over Men to their eternal deſtruction: For in that ſenſe this Kingdom of his may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be fitly called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Empire &amp; Dominion of death, from the effect of it, in that it was deadly and deſtructive to Man.</p>
            <p>But to the great joy of us all, and that we may ever adore and magnifie <hi>the bleſſed and only Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate,</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50877:8"/>being wholly deprived of his Tyranny, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed too, as if he were not at all, as to any hurt that he can do us; our ſtrong <hi>Helper</hi> and mighty <hi>Deliverer,</hi> the holy and ever bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, God and Man, having reſcued us out of the jaws of death and deſtruction, by deſtroying him that had the power of it. The promiſed <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> hath <hi>puniſhed</hi> that <hi>piercing and crooked Serpent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.</note> hath <hi>broken the head of</hi> that <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>terrible Leviathan,</hi>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.14.</note> in ſuch a way as that he hath truly ſhewed himſelf to be the <hi>Seed of the Woman.</hi> The Conqueſt was obtained by him in Humane nature, and that not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſuch Wounds as he in that nature was capable of, not without the honourable marks of a Bloody Victory. For, as Chriſt the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> did bruiſe the Serpents <hi>Head;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</note> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Serpent was permitted to bruiſes his <hi>Heel.</hi> Through <hi>Death</hi> he <hi>deſtroyed</hi> him that had the <hi>Power</hi> of death.</p>
            <p>And now having thus far given ſome account of the ſeveral words and expreſſions in my Text, the full import of the Doctrin of it will be more clearly ſtated, by comparing the proper Notion of the Bondage and Deliverance there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome few particulars which are to be conſidered, as they are Dependant and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon that which is primarily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; or as they belong to that Application,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50877:9"/>which it is but reaſonable we ſhould make of the whole to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a Yet-remaining Bondage, to which the Fear of Death doth make Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men Subject, muſt be acknowledged, which may admit of ſeveral Degrees, as they are more or leſs <hi>the Servants of Sin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16, 17, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 13.</note> Becauſe, not <hi>having the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> not <hi>through the Spirit mortifying the deeds of the Body;</hi> But <hi>ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, living in Malice and Envy, Hateful and Hating one another;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3.</note> They muſt in their own Thoughts be concluded to be ſo far from having any Benefit by that Deliverance which Chriſt hath obtained, as in truth to be <hi>the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18.</note> Though <hi>the Goſpel of</hi> Chriſt be <hi>preached unto</hi> them <hi>as well as unto</hi> others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.</note> yet <hi>the Word preached</hi> doth <hi>not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them;</hi> not begetting that <hi>Hope</hi> in them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</note> by which they are enabled to <hi>purifie</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>to have always a Conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and toward Men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore (unleſs they be groſſy deluded) being ſenſible that the Death of Chriſt is of no Advantage to them, while they Continue in an impenitent State; It is impoſſible but that they muſt Fear Death, and cannot be ſuppoſed even to think themſelves Delivered from this Fear, by the Death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But the Bondage in my Text, and our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50877:9"/>from it, are in this preſent Diſcourſe to be looked upon, not with reſpect to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject, but to the Common Nature of Man, Chriſt himſelf only excepted: The Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage as incident to Humane Nature, as Faln and Depraved; And the Deliverance from it, as that which All men ſtand in Need of, and of which all are Capable, as to the Foundation of it, that is laid in the Death of Chriſt, and with the Refuſal of which all are Chargeable, to whom the tender of it is made by the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We are All either Actually under it, or, as to any thing that is in our ſelves, Subject to the greateſt extremity of it, or we are in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure actually Delivered from the Effects of it, and have a comfortable proſpect of a Compleat Deliverance. <hi>All have Sinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God; Being juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Only of this, to prevent all Preſumption, we muſt ever be mindful, that thoſe Only are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>to</hi> whom <hi>now there is no Condemnation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2.</note> who <hi>are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> Such in whom <hi>the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made</hi> them <hi>Free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is alſo a Farther Bondage, which is Conſequent on the Fear of Temporal Death,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50877:10"/>when Men for Fear of Perſecution, or Death, do commit Sin, or neglect any part of their Duty; by that means endeavouring to avoid what they fear; our Deliverance from which is Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon our cordial Belief of that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which Chriſt hath obtained for us by his Death. For if we truly believe That, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in it as our Happineſs, Why ſhould we be afraid of them which <hi>Kill the Body, but are not able to Kill the Soul?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28.</note> Nay, doth not our Faith, if it be lively and ſincere, teach us above all things to <hi>fear him, which is able to Deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. &amp;c.</note> Ever <hi>fearing leſt a Promiſe being left us of entring into Gods reſt, any of</hi> us ſhould fail of it through <hi>Unbelief:</hi> Of which there can be no greater inſtance than by Slighting that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance our Saviour hath obtained for us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we place no Confidence in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is alſo a Fear of Death, to which Weak, though Sincere Chriſtians may be in ſome meaſure Subject, which may at Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much Diſturb them, as to Approach very near to the Bondage here in my Text; and which is at all times both their Unhappineſs and their Sin. This proceeds from great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in their Faith, and in other Graces, and generally from great Neglect of what their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profeſſion doth call them to.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50877:10"/>
            <p>Now, though the ſerious Conſideration of the Deliverance here in my Text, and mens hearty Endeavors to <hi>work out</hi> their Intereſt in it, <hi>with fear and trembling</hi> of another nature,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</note> and of a better temper, are fit Means under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, wholly to Suppreſs or Mitigate theſe Fears; Yet our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from This fear of Death, is not the thing I am in Particular to conſider, but only in General, as there is a ſufficient Foundation laid for this Deliverance, if it be fully Aſſented to, and duly Applied.</p>
            <p>The Main thing therefore to be conſidered in our Deliverance from the Fear of Death, through the Death of our ever bleſſed and moſt compaſſionate Redeemer, and through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Love of God to Man-kind, is this, That <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</note> Our being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the eternal Wrath and Anger of God, was the Only thing that was formidable in Death, and This being taken away by the Death of Chriſt, there is nothing remains in Death, as it is a bare Separation of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, why we ſhould be afraid of it. All thoſe that are truly Penitent and Regenerate by the grace of Gods Spirit, have now abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a perpetual Security and calmneſs of mind, either in Life or Death. To all ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50877:11"/>
               <hi>To live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.</note> They can look chearfully upon Death, and will not commit the leaſt Sin to decline it.</p>
            <p>It is only their Way to Happineſs, and all the Harſhneſs that it ſeems to have, is from ſome Natural Difficulties, which the God of Nature ſeems to have implanted in Men, that they might not be out of love with Life, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſerve God here <hi>in</hi> their <hi>Generations, till</hi> their <hi>Change come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.14.</note> To which, when a Good man doth underſtand that he is now made to approach by Providence, and the good Hand of God, all thoſe natural Impreſſions, being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, do then give place to the Exerciſe of Faith; And he doth not only calmly reſign his Spirit into the hands of God, and truſt the Salvation of his Soul with his gracious Redeemer, but to Depart this Life, and to enter upon a better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes now his Wiſh and his Choice.</p>
            <p>For he is ſo far now from fearing Everlaſting Death, that he hath a clear proſpect of an happy Eternity: Seeing that Chriſt hath not only <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</note> but <hi>hath brought life and immortality to light, through the Goſpel.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I muſt further add, that the Doctrine of my Text thus explain'd, is ſo far from giving encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Sin; that this Deliverance which we have from the fear of Eternal Death, by the Death of Chriſt, is in truth one of the moſt powerful Motives to Holineſs of life: Seeing that we are hereby aſſured that our pious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will be Accepted of in Chriſt, and meet with their wiſh'd for Succeſs, which without the knowledge of our Peace being made with God, no man could have any Aſſurance of. If it were not for This, All that we could do, would be indeed worſe than at a Peradventure, and could have no better Grounds to warrant its Acceptance with God, in order to the Saving of our Souls, than only ſuch ſeemingly fair Hopes, and probable Conjectures, as a Well-bred <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50877:12"/>might have had, to enforce the application of himſelf to the ſtudy and practice of ſuch Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Virtues as might be beneficial to Man-kind; and to keep up that <hi>Decorum</hi> which the very Manlineſs of the apprehenſions and powers which he had, might require from him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his ſuppoſing of his Condition to be leſs hazardous, when he ſhould leave this World. Of whom it may yet be preſumed, That his Knowledge of that fatal Curſe which lay upon all Man-kind, was as ſlender as his Ability could be, to direct all he did to the Glory of God, which yet is in truth the very Soul and Life of Religion.</p>
            <p>It is therefore to be well obſerved what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>

                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22.</note> That Chriſt did <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> them <hi>unto</hi> God <hi>in the Body of his fleſh through Death,</hi> that he might <hi>preſent</hi> them <hi>holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and unreprovable in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before they were Reconciled to God, they could not be thus Unblameable and Unreprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in any ſenſe: And, After they were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, we muſt ſuppoſe that there were many Defects in them, which if God had been extream to obſerve in the greateſt Rigour, they could not have been able to have defended themſelves againſt his ſevere Scrutiny. Yet, they being Reconciled to God through the Blood of Chriſt, thoſe inſtances of New Obedience, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50877:12"/>by the Grace of God did truly proceed from the Honeſty and Integrity of their Hearts, were ſo favourably Accepted of, that He that had before reconciled their Perſons to God, through his Death, could conſequently repreſent what they thus faithfully did, as Holy, Unblameable and Unreproveable in the ſight of God; that is, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his ſight, free from all Charge of Sin from the <hi>Accuſer</hi> of the <hi>Brethren.</hi>

            <p>Thus I have given you ſome account of the Notion of the <hi>Bondage</hi> mentioned in my Text, and of the Nature of that <hi>Deliverance</hi> which we have through the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, from the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Death:</hi> Which in ſhort is this, That Chriſt did ſuffer Death upon the Croſs in our ſtead, that we might be freed from Eternal Death; That our Guilt being taken away, we might be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from that Curſe, to which we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious by the breach of Gods Law; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, That being <hi>dead with Chriſt, we</hi> may <hi>believe that we ſhall alſo live with him,</hi> having this undoubted Aſſurance, to encourage us to lead ſuch Lives as become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>

            <p>Having therefore by Gods Aſſiſtance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the Firſt thing I propoſed to my ſelf, to treat of in this Diſcourſe; I now come 2dly. To offer to your moſt ſerious Thoughts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50877:13"/>ſome of the moſt pertinent Conſiderations I can think of, to quicken our Apprehenſions of the whole matter, and diſpoſe us for Receiving the kindly Influences of all, in ſuch a way as may be moſt agreeable to the Solemn Occaſion of our meeting together This Day.</p>
            <p>Had you One in this Place that were able fully and clearly to lay before you the Subject that This Day calls upon us to Conſider, What warm Affections would it beget in you! What Tears would it draw from your eyes! What Eſteem and value would you have for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion, the Foundation of which, and of all our hopes and expectation is laid in what we this day commemorate!</p>

            <p>Our Deliberate Thoughts of our Saviours Death and Paſſion would clear up to us many important Truths.

            <p>Of ſo great Importance is it to us, in all theſe reſpects, and for the inciting of us to all Courage and Reſolution in the doing of our Duty; Such an abundant matter will it afford us of Praiſing and magnifying the Wiſdom and Mercy of God, and the Love and compaſſionate Kindneſs of our gracious Redeemer; Such powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will it afford us to love, fear, and obey God, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom he hath <hi>ſent:</hi> So
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50877:15"/>much are we concerned to have the Subject of This Day, and of my Text firmly fixed and rooted in our Minds, and in our Hearts! Even This ſo great and neceſſary Truth of Chriſt's dying for us, and thereby delivering us from the Fear of Death, and from the eternal Wrath of God; To which we were before Obnoxious, and ſo ſhould have been to all eternity, without any Hopes of Deliverance from this dreadful Bondage, or without any Poſſibility that by any thing we could do, we ſhould be Accepted of by God, and admitted to his Favour, If we were not aſſured from the great Mercy which we this day Commemorate, That it is <hi>the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> that <hi>doth purge</hi> our <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Two things therefore more I ſhall briefly do, 1. I ſhall give ſome more particular account from the Scripture of Chriſts Dying for us. And 2. I ſhall point at ſome of thoſe Heads from whence your own Thoughts may make a yet farther, and a more cloſe Practical Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some more particular account from the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Death of Chriſt is repreſented to us in the Scripture as a Propitiatory Sacrifice, and the Price of our Redemption.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>By</hi> him <hi>we have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50877:16"/>now received the Atonement.</hi> And, <hi>When we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 10. V. 1.</note> 
               <hi>We have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He hath <hi>made peace through the Blood of his Croſs,</hi> Coloſ. 1.20. <hi>We have Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Coloſ. 1.14. <hi>The Chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.5.</p>
            <p>And this is more apparent, becauſe together with the mention of I his, there is a manifeſt Intimation of Gods Acceptance of it in our Stead. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>by the Grace of God,</hi> to have <hi>taſted Death</hi> for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. In our Stead he ſuffered Death, and Gods Grace and ſpecial Favour is acknowledged in all this, in that it was For Us that he died, that God Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, As Such. And therefore <hi>God's Love</hi> did appear to <hi>the World in giving his only begotten Son;</hi> In <hi>ſending</hi> him, <hi>that the World through him might be ſaved,</hi> John 3.16, 17. God by all This hath ſhewed himſelf ſo clearly to be <hi>for us,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> asks the queſtion, <hi>Who</hi> then <hi>can be againſt us? He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, How ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things? Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.31, 32,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50877:16"/>33, 34. His Reſurrection giving abundant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Dignity of the Sacrifice of his Death, and of Gods gracious Acceptance of it, And his Interceſſion for us, making good to us the Effects of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Gods Favour to us was to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in This Way, namely, by the Death of Chriſt, is ſo clearly foretold in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. that nothing can be more. And the ſame was alſo Typified by the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, by the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and by what the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> did on the great <hi>Day of Atonement.</hi> Thus Chriſt did <hi>put away Sin by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26. <hi>By his own Blood he obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us,</hi> Ver. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this ſhould be done, is repreſented to us in the Scripture as a gracious and wiſe Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of God, and as an Agreement between God the Father, and the Son. Thus what was done <hi>againſt Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28.</note> is ſaid to have been <hi>before determined</hi> by the <hi>Hand and Counſel</hi> of God. And <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>taken Jeſus, and by wicked hands</hi> to <hi>have crucified and ſlain</hi> him, <hi>being delivered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Agreement between God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son,<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Pearſon</hi> on the <hi>Creed,</hi> p. 185.</note> that the Son ſhould do all this on our behalf, we read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11. of the <hi>Lords bruiſing him and putting him to grief,</hi> and of <hi>making his Soul an offering for Sin,</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>bear the Iniquities</hi> of many: Upon his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50877:17"/>all which, it's ſaid, that <hi>he ſhall ſee his Seed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> Now the Declaration of the Sons Readineſs to do all this, that ſo all might be effected that was agreed to by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow upon it, is expreſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. &amp;c. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a Body haſt thou prepared me: In Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices for Sin thou haſt had no pleaſure: Then ſaid I, Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>By the which Will we are Sanctified, through the offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> Than all which nothing can be more clear: So that thoſe men muſt be ſuppoſed to Delight in Contradiction, that can be bold and forward to object any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manifeſt Evidence of all this.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, and laſtly, The Scripture doth give us ſome Grounds, according to our weak meaſure of judging of the great and high things of God, whereupon we may obſerve the Fitneſs of all this, and the Suitableneſs of thoſe Means that have been uſed, to the good and wiſe Ends for which they were uſed.</p>
            <p>That an Expiation in general was neceſſary, Mans Weakneſs to fulfil the Law doth ſeem to be one Reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50877:17"/>for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh:</hi> Or, (as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>for ſin,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Margent of that Place) <hi>By a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin he condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And many Reaſons have been given, why a Satisfaction ſhould be made, before God would pardon Sin, with reſpect to the Holineſs of God, and to the ſecuring a due Honour and Regard to his Law, and to the expreſſing how Odious Sin was in the ſight of God. That ſo men, by having Pardon over-eaſily granted, might not be Encouraged to Sin, or at leaſt not ſo much Deterr'd from it: And that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge of All This by conſidering at what a heavy Price our Redeemer purchaſed Pardon for us.</p>
            <p>And the Wiſdom of God doth farther appear in this, That the Price of our Redemption was to to be paid in Our Nature: In which Nature alſo he was to take Poſſeſſion of Heaven; and therefore, a little before he left this World, he laid this Conſideration before his Sorrowful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Comfort them,<note place="margin">

               <hi>I go to prepare a Place for you, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Reaſons may alſo be given in Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Places as theſe, namely, That <hi>the Captain of</hi> our <hi>Salvation</hi> was to be made <hi>perfect through Sufferings;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26.</note> And, That <hi>Chriſt ought to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory.</hi> For,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50877:18"/>beſides the Correſpondence that cannot but be between what God hath Fore-told, and what doth come to paſs, it may not be unfit to obſerve a Denotation in all this of Gods Ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in dealing with the Sons of Men; He having thought it convenient to Exerciſe them with many Hardſhips before he bring them to an Immutable Happineſs. And therefore, God having determined that thoſe whom he <hi>purpoſed</hi> to <hi>Glorifie</hi> ſhould, even in this reſpect, be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Image of his Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29.</note> It was neceſſary that by Suffering he ſhould be the <hi>Firſt-born among many Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we ſhould Learn from what befel him to Expect Sufferings, and from his Example both to be Willing to ſuffer, and How to ſuffer; That God is to be Glorified in All that we are, or are Capable of, as well in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in Doing, That we ſhould never decline any Suffering,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> or any Occaſion of it, <hi>for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake:</hi> And that, even when we <hi>ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> we are ſo to behave our ſelves as by our Chriſtian-like Deportment to expreſs that Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Patience and Submiſſion, and hearty Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Perſecutors, which he did expreſs to the wonder of all that beheld him. We muſt hence learn to be <hi>Subject</hi> to all thoſe that have Authority over us, <hi>not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward:</hi> For unto this matter doth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50877:18"/>St. <hi>Peter</hi> apply the Argument he fetcheth from what our Saviour ſuffered, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Telling us that <hi>Hereunto we are called, becauſe that Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps: Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again: When he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> This reaſon of the Fitneſs of our Saviours Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is very Pious, and the Application of it moſt Neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But whatever Reaſons we may take notice of, they muſt all be conſidered with reſpect to Gods Decree and good pleaſure, and may not ſo be laid down as to make what We may Apprehend as Neceſſary, a Limiting of the abſolute Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Divine Will.</p>
            <p>Which being premiſed, I am willing a little farther to inſiſt upon the Conſideration of the Fitneſs that Chriſt ſhould take Our nature upon him, and therein ſuffer for us, from what we read in the next <hi>Verſe</hi> but one after my Text, That <hi>It behoved him in all things to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the Sins of the people.</hi> Upon theſe Two things I ſhall lay the main Streſs of the matter, and conſider them in ſuch a way as may be moſt pertinent to the main Subject of my Text.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50877:19"/>
            <p n="1">1. That he might be a <hi>Merciful High-Prieſt,</hi> the eternal Son of God took our nature upon him. Not that he needed this to make any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his Mercy, which is infinite; but that having thoſe Affections that are Common to our nature, and in our nature having had a lively Senſe and Experience of <hi>our Infirmities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.</note> We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that infinite diſtance there is between the Incomprehenſible and Self-ſufficient God, and our poor Defective and Polluted nature, might with the greater Aſſurance go to this <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> this <hi>God with us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. <hi>John</hi> 1.14.</note> to <hi>the Word</hi> that <hi>was made fleſh and dwelt among us,</hi> and lay open all our wants before him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> as the <hi>One Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, the infinite Perfections of God, which are nothing elſe but the one ſame uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſſence, though apprehended by us under differing Conceptions, which we call Juſtice, Mercy, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo far above our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that when according to our Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we endeavour to form ſuch Notions of them as may be a ſufficient Ground for our Truſt and Confidence, without the leſt Wavering, or even Suſpicion that our Ignorance may be Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to us, we find our minds ſo Dazled with the exceeding glory of the Object, and our thoughts ſo divided, and many times Contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that the more we Think of that which cannot be Comprehended by us, the more we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50877:19"/>are Confounded, and do at laſt find it Impoſſible to have any firm Reſt and aſſurance for the Soul, which can pretend to Exceed that Diſcovery we have of God in Chriſt. He that confiders what our Saviour hath told us of himſelf, <hi>I am the way and the truth, and the life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6.</note> 
               <hi>No man cometh unto the Father but by me,</hi> muſt be wanting to himſelf in admitting that light which he may receive, if he be at any loſs in the certainty of this, That as in Chriſt we have all requiſite Knowledge of God, ſo in and through him we can only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find the Great God, <hi>who is Glorious in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11.</note> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to us.</p>
            <p>It is therefore our Happineſs that we have an High-Prieſt, who having taken our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, hath thereby brought what is Neceſſary for us to know of God to that Meaſure that we are able to reach to. The ſafeſt Proſpect we can take of Gods infinite Attributes, is in him that is <hi>the brightneſs of Gods glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> And though it may be a dangerous Curioſity to lanch out too far into this Depth, yet this is our Comfort, and it ſhould be our main Concern, that we have in Chriſt not only a Satisfactory, but even a Glorious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that particular Attribute of God, in which our loſt Condition is chiefly concerned, even that of <hi>Mercy</hi> in our <hi>Merciful High-Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50877:20"/>
            <p n="2">2. It behoved the Son of God to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful High-Prieſt,</hi> in things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People.</p>
            <p>He having Undertaken to make Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by ſo doing to ſhew himſelf in a moſt eminent manner to be <hi>our High-Prieſt,</hi> and the Manner of this reconciliation being Agreed on between the Father and the Son, how could it be but that the only Happineſs of Sinful and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Men muſt depend upon the making of ſuch a reconciliation as would be Effectual? How can we apprehend Chriſt to have been a <hi>Merciful</hi> High-Prieſt, but we muſt conclude that he was therefore a <hi>Faithful</hi> High-Prieſt? His Mercy inclined him to Compaſſionate our miſery, and to Intercede with God for Pardon, as our <hi>High-Prieſt;</hi> and therefore as our <hi>Faithful</hi> High-Prieſt, he did not only Intercede for us, but he interceded for us Powerfully. He did all that in the Wiſdom and Decree of God was neceſſary to obtain our Reconciliation. Thus <hi>in all things he was like unto his brethren, that he might be a faithful High-Prieſt;</hi> that what we had need of, and what his undertaking the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator did teach us to expect, might fully anſwer our Wants and our Expectation from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the promiſes of God are in Chriſt Yea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</note> 
               <hi>and in him Amen.</hi> Every Declaration of the Favour and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50877:20"/>Love of God the Father to us, is to have its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion through Chriſt, <hi>in whom</hi> as his <hi>beloved Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17.</note> he is <hi>well pleaſed,</hi> and in whom alone he is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14.</note> And this Declaration of <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> and <hi>Good will towards Men,</hi> is ſo ſurely Founded, and firmly Ratified in Chriſt, that we are taught to ground our Expectation of it upon the Faithfulneſs of God: In ſo much, that in the general, every Act of a truly Chriſtian and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith, by which we <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of Chriſt, is a <hi>ſetting</hi> to our <hi>Seal that God is true;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.33.</note> and in particular, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins</hi> (which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Acknowledgment of Guilt and Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Divine Wrath, and our looking upon Chriſt as the Propitiation for our Sins, together with that true Repentance, and ſincere Affection of the Heart, which this Confeſſion as being made not to Man, but to God, doth require) we are then taught to look upon God, as one that is <hi>faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, As all this declares the Faithfulneſs of God, and the Excellency of Faith, which not only aſcribes the greateſt Honour to God, but receives that Honour from God, as to have no leſs Evidence of its Certainty, than there is of the Unchangeableneſs of God himſelf; ſeeing that it is impoſſible but that God ſhould Accept what he hath freely declared, that he will accept on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50877:21"/>our behalf from him whom he hath appointed the Mediator between himſelf and us: So all this doth ſuppoſe that this Mediator doth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform what, as ſuch, he undertakes to perform, in order that it may be Accepted of by God.</p>
            <p>And therefore, ſeeing that the Holy Spirit of God in Scripture hath declared,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26.</note> That <hi>God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the Forbearance of God: That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in jeſus,</hi> It becomes neceſſary, according to this wiſe Appointment of God, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Himſelf and the <hi>one Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men,</hi> that this Mediator ſhould be <hi>made like</hi> unto us, and in this likeneſs, that is, in our nature, ſuffer for our ſins: That he might be a <hi>faithful High Prieſt,</hi> that he might in truth and reality, and in the rigor of Juſtice perform all, <hi>in things pertaining to God,</hi> which was thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>to make reconciliation for the ſins of the People.</hi> Even all that, as <hi>our High Prieſt,</hi> he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to perform for our Perfect and Full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and without which God was not obliged by any thing that he had freely Promiſed to Accept of his Offering in our ſtead. For from what hath been ſaid, and from the farther evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that Place (with which I will ſhut up
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50877:21"/>this point) <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>and (having made peace through the blood of his Croſs) by him to reconcile all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> it is put beyond all doubt that the Fathers Reconciling all things to Himſelf by the Son, was no otherwiſe in the purpoſe and decree of God practicable, but by the Peace which Chriſt made by the Blood of his Croſs.</p>
            <p>In all this we may diſcern much, though we cannot reach to the whole, of that aſtoniſhing Wiſdom and Goodneſs which is in the Scripture ſet forth to us, in that the eternal Son of God took upon him our nature, that in that Nature he might by Death deliver us from that Bondage to which we were ſubject through Fear of Death; from which we have the greater ſecurity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though it could be performed in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature only, yet the Dignity of his Perſon added an ineſtimable value to his ſufferings.
